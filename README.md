# Notes App

A nice and simple notes app. Built with simple JavaScript and Bootstrap.

Functions, If/Else, DOM, JSON.parse() method, and a very few other things were implemented.

You can add notes and see them in the notes list. There is an option to delete the notes as well.

Will I ever use this notes app? Absolutely not. A little project to start with.
